is a  application designed for efficient data management and processing. Its architecture is based on a client-server model that provides secure and reliable communication between client requests and the database.
Key components:

Server: The main part of the application that provides centralised processing of requests from clients. The server is designed to process data, interact with the database, and provide clients with the necessary information.

Database: A data repository used to permanently store and access information. The programme works with the MySql database

Client: A text-based interface that allows users to interact with the application through an intuitive user interface. The client part provides functionality for sending queries to the server and displaying the resulting data.
